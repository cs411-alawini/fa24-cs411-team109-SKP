## Project Summary
(GOT TA APPROVAL FROM ANAY BHAKAT)

Our platform enhances the Spotify experience by allowing users to rate and comment on songs, a feature currently unavailable on Spotify. By integrating with Spotify’s API, users can authenticate with their Spotify accounts and use their Spotify usernames on our site. They can comment and rate songs, and ratings are averaged and visualized for easy viewing. 
To provide some initial content to the users, we plan to add songs/albums based on Spotify’s popular playlists and retrieve editorial notes for albums from Apple Music to display them with the albums in our database.  
Additionally, users can receive personalized playlist recommendations based on their comments and listening history, and optional features include analyzing their musical tastes and building a community for users with similar preferences.
